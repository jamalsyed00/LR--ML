# LR--ML
Logistic Regression- ML assignment

The model is a logistic regression model that uses the cross entropy loss function as its loss function to update the weights. The model runs over 10 independent 70:30 train:test data splits. Both GD and SGD are used to update the model parameters. It outputs the average accuracy, loss, precision, recall, and f-score over the 10 splits and also outputs the loss and accuracy for each split. The final weights array is the coefficients to be used to calculate the probability a prediction. An average accuracy of 99.83% and an average f-score of 99.8% was achieved.
